\title{Rewire a Network Matrix}
\usage{
rewireNetworkCpp(R, initialIter)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{A numeric matrix representing the network's adjacency matrix.}

\item{initialIter}{The number of iterations for the rewiring process.}
}
\value{
A rewired numeric matrix representing the network's adjacency matrix.
}
\description{
This function takes a network represented as an adjacency matrix and
performs a specified number of edge rewiring iterations to randomize the network.
It checks for network density and skips rewiring if the network is fully connected.
