\title{Convert Matrix Weights to Lengths}
\usage{
length_inversion(W)

length_inversion(W)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A numeric matrix whose weights represent connection strengths.}

\item{wcm}{Unused in this version of the function, included for compatibility with previous versions.}
}
\value{
A matrix where each non-zero weight has been converted to its reciprocal value, representing the length.
}
\description{
Converts the weights in a numeric matrix to lengths based on the principle that length is
inversely proportional to the connection strength. This function first validates the input matrix,
sets its diagonal elements to zero to avoid self-connections, and then converts all non-zero
weights to their reciprocal values, effectively transforming weights into lengths.
}
\examples{
W <- matrix(c(0, 2, 0, 0.5, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0.5, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), 4, 4)
lengths_W <- weight_conversion(W, 'lengths')

Validates the input matrix and ensures no self-connections by setting diagonal elements to zero.
