\title{Calculate the Characteristic Path Length of a Graph}
\usage{
characteristic_path_length(W, validate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A square matrix adjacency matrix, where edges represent connection
strength.}

\item{validate}{Whether to validate the input matrix.}
}
\value{
The characteristic path length of the graph as a single
numerical value. This represents the average shortest path
length between all pairs of nodes.
}
\description{
This function computes the characteristic path length of a graph,
which is defined as the average length of the shortest paths
for all pairs of nodes in the graph. The function expects a
distance matrix where the element at the i-th row and j-th
column represents the length of the shortest path from node i
to node j.
}
\examples{
# Example usage with a simple 3-node (triangular) graph
W <- matrix(c(0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 0, 3, 5, 1, 3, 0, 6, 4, 5, 6, 0), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
characteristic_path_length(W)
