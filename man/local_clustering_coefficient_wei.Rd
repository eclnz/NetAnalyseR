\title{Calculate Local Clustering Coefficient for Weighted Undirected Networks}
\usage{
local_clustering_coefficient_wei(W)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A square, symmetric matrix representing the weighted undirected
connection matrix of the network. Edge weights must be between 0 and 1
for meaningful interpretation, although this is not strictly enforced
by the function. Weights can be normalized using \code{weight_conversion()}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the local clustering coefficient for
each node in the network.
}
\description{
This function computes the local clustering coefficient for each node
in a weighted undirected network. The clustering coefficient is a measure
of the degree to which nodes in a network cluster together, taking into
account the weight of the edges. This implementation is based on the method
proposed by Onnela et al. (2005), which is suitable for networks where
edge weights represent the strength of connections between nodes.
}
\examples{
# Example usage with a simple weighted network
W <- matrix(c(0, 0.5, 0.2,
              0.5, 0, 0.4,
              0.2, 0.4, 0), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
local_clustering_coefficient_wei(W)
