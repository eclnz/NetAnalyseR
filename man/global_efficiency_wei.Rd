\title{Calculate Global Efficiency of a Weighted Graph}
\usage{
global_efficiency_wei(W)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A square, symmetric matrix representing the weighted adjacency matrix of an undirected graph.
Weights should be non-negative, and diagonal elements (self-loops) are ignored in the calculation.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the global efficiency of the graph.
}
\description{
This function calculates the global efficiency of a weighted graph based on the weighted adjacency matrix.
Global efficiency is a measure of the average inverse shortest path length in the graph, providing an indication
of how efficiently information is exchanged across the entire network. The function validates the input matrix,
sets diagonal elements to zero to ignore self-loops, converts the weights to lengths, calculates the inverse of
the shortest path length for each pair of nodes, and then computes the global efficiency from these values.

# Example: Create a 3x3 weighted adjacency matrix
W <- matrix(c(0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
