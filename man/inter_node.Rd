\title{Calculate the Total Inter-Node Connections in a Network}
\usage{
inter_node(W)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A square, numeric matrix representing a weighted connection matrix of the network.
The matrix should represent an undirected network, meaning connections are symmetric.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the sum of weights of all unique inter-node connections.
}
\description{
This function calculates the total number of connections between nodes in a network,
specifically focusing on undirected networks. It processes a weighted connection matrix,
setting self-connections to zero and considering only unique connections due to the network's undirected nature.
}
\examples{
# Create a 4x4 undirected, weighted connection matrix
W <- matrix(c(0, 1, 3, 2,
              1, 0, 2, 4,
              3, 2, 0, 5,
              2, 4, 5, 0), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 4)
inter_node(W)
}
