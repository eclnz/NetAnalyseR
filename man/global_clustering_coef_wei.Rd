\title{Calculate the Global Clustering Coefficient for a Weighted Undirected Graph}
\usage{
global_clustering_coef_wei(W)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{A square, symmetric matrix representing the weighted adjacency matrix of an undirected graph.
The matrix should have non-negative weights, and diagonal elements are ignored in the computation.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the global clustering coefficient of the graph.
}
\description{
This function calculates the global clustering coefficient of a weighted undirected graph.
The global clustering coefficient is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
The function first validates the input matrix to ensure it represents a proper adjacency matrix of a graph,
sets the diagonal elements to zero to ignore self-loops, and then computes the mean local clustering coefficient
across all nodes as the global clustering coefficient.

# Example: Create a 3x3 weighted adjacency matrix
W <- matrix(c(0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
